    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
		<p>I liked the that the modules, the videos, and the lectures were all so neatly organized and were a great reference
             to exactly what we were working on for the week. You were very thorough in explaining everything, even if it did take me 
             a little longer to catch on.
        </p>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1> 
        <p>I honestly would not change a thing about the the course. The information was very well organized and you were more than happy to explain everything to me and to all
            us more than once. 
        </p>   
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1> 
        <p>I learned more and then some. Going into this course, I did not know anything about what really entailed to make a webpage. I learned how to actually recognize code in html and javascript.
           I learned the basics of how to code in html and css. I really appreciate the work that you put into teaching the class. 
       </p>   
    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>This was my first time taking any computer courses in my life. Everything was new and very challenging. I enjoyed being out of my comfort zone
            and excited to be learning a new skill set.
        </p>
